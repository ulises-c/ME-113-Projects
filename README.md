# ME-113-Projects
- Two thermodynamics projects in the SJSU ME 113 course for Fall 2020

## First Project
#### Engine outer surface temperature investigation for oil autoignition 
- Problem: Oil leakage on the hot engine can create fire hazard. Some engine oils have an autoignition temperature of 250°C. Consider an outer surface of an engine where oil leakage is occurring. The emissivity of the engine surface is about 0.3 and its inner surface is subjected to 5kW/m2 of heat flux. The engine surrounding temperature is 40°C and the convection heat transfer coefficient is 15W/mK. To prevent a fire hazard, the temperature of the engine surface should be kept below 200°C. 
- a.	Determine whether oil on the engine surface is at a risk of autoignition. 
- b.	Plot the engine surface temperature as a function of the surrounding temperature that may vary from 10°C to 50°C (step size: 5°C). Mark the fire hazard possibilities at each surrounding temperature. 
- c.	Plot a 3D graph showing surface temperatures as a function of heat flux (varying between 2kW/m2 to 8kW/m2 with a step of 0.5kW/m2) and the surrounding temperature (varying from 10°C to 50°C with a step of 5°C). Mark the autoignition region on the graph. 

## Second Project
#### Steam Power Plant Analysis
- Consider a steam power plant. Steam leaves the boiler at P1 = 2MPa pressure and T1 = 300°C temperature. It enters the turbine by losing some heat along its path with a delta = 5% change in its pressure and temperature. Turbine generates power and releases the saturated mixture at 15 kPa with 90% quality factor to the condenser that cools it down to 45°C at constant pressure. The condenser releases heat to the environment and pushes the liquid to a pump that perform work (4kJ/kg) to push the liquid to the boiler where it is turned to steam by adding heat.
- Find the following:
- 1.	Heat released to the environment from boiler to turbine inlet
- 2.	Heat released from the condenser 
- 3.	Efficiency of the plant 
- 4.	Plot the turbine work as a function of the steam exit temperature from the boiler as it changes from 2 MPa to 2.5 MPa with a step of 0.1 MPa 
- 5.	Plot the turbine work as the steam exit temperatures from the boiler varies from 300°C to 350°C with a step of 50°C. 
- 6.	Plot the turbine work for above two cases. 
- 7.	Plot the plant efficiency for above two cases. 
- 8.	Give you analysis for the case when turbine inlet temperature is increased.
